We are happy to announce the tenth bug fix release of the 1.6 series.

=== Hibernate ORM 6.3 and 6.4 support

The Hibernate 6.2 integration now also supports Hibernate ORM 6.3 and 6.4.
During testing we uncovered some bugs in Hibernate ORM which have been reported and will be fixed in the upcoming releases.

=== Java 21 support

Since Java 21 will be the next LTS release, we decided that ensuring that version works is vital+++<!-- PREVIEW-SUFFIX --><!-- </p></div> --><!-- PREVIEW-END -->+++
and made sure it works by regularly testing with this version on CI.

=== Various bug fixes

As always, this release comes with quite a few bug fixes, so we recommend you update soon!
